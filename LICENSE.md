# Licensing Intent

## Apache 2.0
This project and reference implementation are released under the **Apache License, Version 2.0**.

We chose this license because:
1.  **Permissive**: You can use this code in proprietary software, open-source projects, or research without "viral" restrictions.
2.  **Patent Non-Assertion**: It includes an explicit patent grant. This means that contributors to this project promise not to sue you for patent infringement regarding the contributions they made. This is critical for an open hardware/software standard.

## Public Domain for Specs
The text of the *specification files* (SPECIFICATION.md, PHILOSOPHY.md) is dedicated to the public domain (CC0), to the maximum extent possible. We want the *idea* to be free, while the *code* is protected by Apache 2.0 to ensure safe contribution cycles.

## Why Openness Matters
An identity or presence protocol must be trusted. Trust requires transparency. By ensuring the core logic is open and unencumbered by legal threats, we allow:
*   **Security Audits**: White-hat hackers can test the limits of the physics.
*   **Adoption**: Companies can integrate it without fear of future "rent-seeking."
*   **Resilience**: The protocol survives even if the original authors disappear.
